Using WP for a company site? Then you should install LEAN WP to make the WordPress front- and back-end suitable for companies.
LEAN WP: WordPress for companies, without the bloat!

## Description

WordPress is getting bloated. And that is especially true if you're using WP to build a company website. 

Customizer, Distraction Free Writing, Emojis, Embeds, the list keeps getting larger with more nonsense and more bloat. There have been rumors about forking WordPress to have a more business oriented version, but such things are merely talk and will never really get off the ground.

The better way in our opinion is to use the WP infrastructure and to simply remove all the unwanted things by using actions and filters.

The result is LEAN WP.
